# Data-Analysis-Visualizations-Linear-Regression-Tutorial

I created this notebook for a tutorial on how to conduct exploratory data analysis in Pandas, create visualizations in Matplotlib, and perform linear regressions with scikit-learn. The tutorial was used for a new member education for a club at Cornell. My intention is that the tutorial can serve as an introduction to these libraries and as a refresher for those who have used these libraries before.
